- For React Router 7+, import routing components (BrowserRouter, Route, Routes, Link, etc.) from 'react-router' instead of 'react-router-dom'
  ```tsx
  // Correct for v7+
  import { BrowserRouter, Route, Routes } from 'react-router';
  
  // Avoid (v6 and earlier style)
  import { BrowserRouter, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
  ```
- Continue using 'react-router-dom' for DOM-specific components if they're not available in 'react-router'
